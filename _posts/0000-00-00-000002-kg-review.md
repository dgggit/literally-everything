# Introduction
This post summarizes the seminar report, '[Knowledge Graphs: New Directions for Knowledge Representation on the Semantic Web](https://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2019/10328/) (from [Reports on Dagstuhl Seminar](https://dblp.org/db/journals/dagstuhl-reports/index.html) 18371)'. 

Knowledge Graph(KG) 앞으로는 KG라고 사용하기로 한다.
this thang is real goooood

순서에 따라 정리하고 나름대로 정리해봤다.

Recently, I mainly concentrate on two subjects, which are **1. Integrating AI(especially NLP) with KGs** and **2. How KGs can be generated and can evolve throughout the web(internet)**. 여기에 대해 추가적인 reference나 나의 opinion을 기술할 수도 있다.
