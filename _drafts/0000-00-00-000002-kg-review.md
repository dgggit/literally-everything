# Introduction
This post summarizes the seminar report, '[Knowledge Graphs: New Directions for Knowledge Representation on the Semantic Web](https://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2019/10328/) (from [Reports on Dagstuhl Seminar](https://dblp.org/db/journals/dagstuhl-reports/index.html) 18371)'. 

Knowledge Graph(KG) 앞으로는 KG라고 사용하기로 한다.
this thang is real goooood

순서에 따라 정리하고 나름대로 정리해봤다. 글의 서두에, 이 글은 본문을 짜깁기하거나 요약했다고 밝히기

Recently, I mainly concentrate on two subjects, which are **1. Integrating AI(especially NLP) with KGs** and **2. How KGs can be generated and can evolve throughout the web(internet)**. 여기에 대해 추가적인 reference나 나의 opinion을 기술할 수도 있다.

> How do we define KGs? How do we represent KGs?

## History of KG
*(contents from **3.13. Concise account of the notion of Knowledge Graphs**, **3.20. (Re)Defining Knowledge Graphs**)*

## Modern Definition
*(contents from **3.20. (Re)Defining Knowledge Graphs**, **3.21. Foundations**)*

## Context Representation
*(contents from **3.21. Foundations**)*

- 뭔가 정의에서 빠져 있다
- formal semantics : (i.e. a graph-based data organization where a schema and multiple labelled relations with formal meaning are available), 
- context representation이 가장 중요하다
- following kinds of context : a~e
- taking context into account (이게 메인)
  - 2가지 지킬 것
  - 4가지 솔루션
  - hybrid reasoning.
